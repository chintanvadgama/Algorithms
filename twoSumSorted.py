2. Two Sum II â€“ Input array is sorted
Code it now: Coming soon! Difficulty: Medium, Frequency: N/A
Question:
Similar to Question [1. Two Sum], except that the input array is already sorted in
ascending order.
Solution:
Of course we could still apply the [Hash table] approach, but it costs us O(n) extra space,
plus it does not make use of the fact that the input is already sorted.
