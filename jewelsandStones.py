# You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
#
# The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
# Output: 3
# Example 2:
#
# Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
# Output: 0
# Note:
#
# S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
# The characters in J are distinct.
